<h2> About me </h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Noah Wagner, I was born and raised in Omaha, NE. I am currently a senior at UNO for Management Information Systems (MIS) and look forward to graduating next semester. I, also, currently have been interning at an IT Help Desk for a company called InterPublic Group (IPG) since December 2018. At IPG, I work with the Messaging team, in which we primarily deal with  messaging issues such as; Microsoft Teams, Azure, Outlook, Skype, and plenty more.
  </p>
  <p>Some fun and interesting info about me is that first and foremost I am a <b>huge</b>  Husker fan (always have been). I have 3 cats (Mia, Theo, and Oliver) as well as one dog who is a bloodtick coonhound named Max. I look forward to learning more in this Web Development class as the semester goes on!
