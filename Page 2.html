    <h1> My IS&T Experiences
 </h1>
 
   <p>As explained on the Home Page, I am currently in my senior year at UNO for MIS. As well as having internship experience at IPG, I have learned a great deal in my time at UNO. I have previously taken an Intro to Web Development class my Sophomore year, while I remember some HTML5 and CSS, this will be a fantastic new learning experience as I have looked forward to furthering my experience(s) and skill(s) for web development (specifically HTML and CSS).
